            There are several reasons why you might be getting an HTTP 404 code:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One typical trigger for an error 404 message is when the page has been deleted from the website.
            </li>
            <li>The page was moved to another URL and the redirection was done incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>You entered an incorrect URL address.
            </li>
            <li>Although it happens very rarely, sometimes the server malfunctions.
            </li>
            <li>The entered domain name does not exist anymore.
            </li>
        </ul>
